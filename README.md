# [100 Years of Bauhaus](https://traveltimn.github.io/bauhaus100/)

From 2002-2003, I studied in [Dessau, Germany](https://goo.gl/maps/1QHpVWvN3wF97kKU8) as an international exchange student. I received a full congressional scholarship through [CBYX](https://exchanges.state.gov/us/program/congress-bundestag-youth-exchange) funded by the US Congress and German Parliament.

Dessau is home to the [Bauhaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bauhaus), which celebrated it's 100th anniversary in 2019. An [article](https://uxdesign.cc/bauhaus-100-years-of-a-great-school-d6736a725d2d) I read online had a cool graphic that I liked, and therefore decided to test my CSS skills by building that same photo using just HTML+CSS.

# Original Photo:

![Bauhaus100](bauhaus-original.png?raw=true "Bauhaus100")

# My CSS:

![Bauhaus100](bauhaus-tim.png?raw=true "Bauhaus100")

## A gif of the original version and my CSS version together:

(it's not 100% perfect, but I made it interactive as well!)
